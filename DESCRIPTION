Description: This package provides the `project_setup()` helper function that allows for quick creation of new research projects. Based on my personal experiences and preferences, it creates a pre-specified folder structure for data, code and images as well as several files, including a pdf `manuscript.qmd` source file, a revealjs `presentation.qmd` source file, an html `code.qmd` notebook, a `references.bib` bibliography template and a `.gitignore` file for version control.
